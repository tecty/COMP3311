1. X-> R-X

2. 
A -> C B -> C 
B -> C B -> A
C -> A C -> B

3.
The relationship is one to one.
Since A-> B we can get for every A value, there's only one B value.
From another B -> A we can get for every B value, there's only one A value.
So for each A has only one B, and vice versa.
Hence the relationship is one to one relationship.

4.
a.
Since A -> B 
so A+ = {A, B}

b.
since A->B, B in ACEG+  
since BC-> F, F in ACEG+
Hence,
ACEG += {A,B, C, E,F, G}

c.
Since BD -> EG. so EG in BD+ 
Since BEG -> FA, so FA in BD+ 
Since AD -> C so C in BD+ 
All the entity is in the set, stop.
Hence,
BD+ = {A, B,C, D,E, F, G}

3. 
a. ACD, BCD, EDC

b. 
Yes, because the right hand side of functional dependency are all keys.

c.
No, because none of the left hand sides contains a key
